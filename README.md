# jsonapi
Small tool to parse and post data to/from a JSON API.
This task is so common nowadays that I'm using this script as a
ground base to start developing around it depending on the task.

# Usage
* Set API_USER and API_PWD environments variables to your API credentials.
* Change the target_url, auth_url and post_url to your API urls.
